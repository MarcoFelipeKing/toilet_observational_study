### To get started:
Open the Toilet_study.Rproj file using RStudio. This will automatically map the file structure and have the contact_analysis.R code loaded up.

Run each line of code by clicking anywhere on that line and pressing ctrl+enter or cmd+end. The first time you run the code, R will install some packages:
"pacman,dplyr,vroom,tidyr,ggplot2,hrbrthemes,stringr,stringi,ggpval,RcolorBrewer".

Sometimes I overlook a package and it needs installing separately but R will tell you if a function can't be found. The best bet is to google it and it will tell you which package it's from.
